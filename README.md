# Multi-Nao-Speach-Orchestration
Repository for code base to get multiple Neo robots with different versions orchestrate speech

## Guideline for setting up the experiment
1. Connect all equipments (e.g., mac mini, tp-link, researcher laptop, robots).
2. Run [the preparation script](https://github.com/UvA-CW-Robo-research/Multi-Nao-Speech-Orchestration/blob/main/preparation.py) to make all robots sit in the same posture and look at the participant.
3. Set up the robots in the right positions. https://github.com/UvA-CW-Robo-research/Multi-Nao-Speech-Orchestration/blob/main/robotsetup.jpeg
4. Run the interaction script.
5. Play the audio for the cover story.
6. Run the experiment script.
